The project focuses on the development of a Spotify web player using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main objective is to create a website that emulates the functionality of the popular Spotify music streaming platform. The website includes a curated collection of songs, allowing users to navigate through them using forward and backward buttons and control playback with pause and resume options.

The project begins by designing and structuring the website using HTML. HTML is used to create the necessary elements and layout, such as song listings, buttons, and player controls. CSS is then applied to style and customize the appearance of the website, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

The core functionality of the web player is implemented using JavaScript. JavaScript enables the dynamic behavior of the website, allowing users to interact with the player controls. Forward and backward buttons are programmed to change the current song, providing seamless navigation within the song collection. Additionally, pause and resume functionality is implemented to give users control over the playback of the selected songs.

The website offers a comprehensive music playback experience within the browser environment. Users can explore the curated song collection, switch between songs using the navigation buttons, and control playback by pausing and resuming as desired. The integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ensures a smooth and interactive user experience, providing a user-friendly and engaging platform for music streaming.
